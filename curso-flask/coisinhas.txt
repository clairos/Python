We can't use the 'make' command on windows and we don't get it preinstalled with MINGW. So to use it, you need to download it first. The steps are as follows-

1. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/postdownload and download it.
2. After the installation is over, go and check if bin folder is present in the directory of MINGW .
3. If everything works well till now, change the environment variables- go to settings of your laptop and type Environment variables. Go to it's section and click on 'environment variables' at the end.
4. On the section where 'path' is written, add a new file - the location of the bin file and save.
5. Install make by typing the following on mingw command line : mingw-get install mingw32-make
6. Now make is installed. To use it in command line just write "mingw32-make" in place of "make".
